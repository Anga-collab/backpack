**Breaking:**

- bpk-component-banner-alert:
  - Updated the banner alert component to use the new spacing grid. This component will now appear larger in height so should be checked this does not alter layout.

**Fixed:**

- bpk-component-breadcrumb:
  - Updated the breadcrumb component to use the new spacing grid and small arrow icons.
